# Predictive Model – Titanic (Classification)

Classification project using the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised machine learning models.

**Status:** In progress  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib  
**Dataset:** Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)

## Objective
To build and evaluate a classification model by:
- performing exploratory data analysis,
- cleaning and transforming the data,
- engineering meaningful features,
- training multiple machine learning models,
- and assessing model performance using key metrics.

## Project Content
- Initial data exploration and variable inspection.
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).
- Feature engineering for improved model performance.
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Comparison of models and selection of the best-performing one.
